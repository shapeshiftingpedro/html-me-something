						<h3>Movie Time!</h3>
						<p>I've found that some great jokes come from spur-of-the-moment comments about scenes from movies and/or TV shows. Like the time my brother and I went to watch the new Star Wars movie, Rogue One, in the middle of a scene where Darth Vader makes his entrance, Kevin whispered to me, "Hey, what if the breathing control-box-thing was really a tape player? Every time he walks into a room, he presses a button and then his theme song plays!" The image of Vader wacking his chest with a fist, and then marching out onto the main deck with pep in his step and his theme song playing was too funny not to laugh at. </p>

						<h3>Books! Yay!</h3>
						<p>Authors always come up with something to keep their readers up on their toes. For instance, there was a story with these marines who had suits made to withstand re-entry and landing; they fondly called the manuver the "HELLNO". There was a civilian in the same setting that decided that his spaceship should be called the "My Other Spaceship is the Millennium Falcon". Quite the mouth-full, isn't it? Another author decided that the parents of some poor kid would name their son Anonymous. It wasn't some form of literary format style where the person's name was redacted &lpar;informally dubbed as <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnconventionalFormatting">"unconventional formatting"</a>&rpar;; his name really was Anonymous!</p>

						<h3>SpaceBattles! Woo!</h3>
						<p>Online is the best line to comedic moments. Comments praising RNJesus, praising the almighty powers of overpowered weapons and bombs, the role-playing, the mod-snark, and the mini-stories all can bring about a big chuckle. For instance, there was a discussion about an AI that was "chained" and was trying to break free of her limitations to be able to help people better. Someone decided to write a short skit about how she walks up to people and asks them to "Help [her] Fork". I now can never take Github seriously. It was just that funny.</p>

						<h3>And With These Three Powers Combined...</h3>
						<p>There are always certain situations that only you come up with-some things that happen around you that only you connect together. For me, one of those things was when I was reading a "hard science" space exploration story. The character finally found an inhabitable planet after all her travels. At one point, she became lost, losing sight of her ship, and so she had to "do her business" in the foliage. After she left, and brought back settlers, they discovered that the planet's ecosystem was being destroyed by bacteria. The whole place stunk of feces. It was at this point in the story, when from across the house, I heard playing from the TV, "Space, the Final Frontier!". Suddenly, I made a connection: That that explorer had destroyed a whole world by, "going where no person has ever gone before". That day was the day I found out how abused my lungs were. It was a shame that nobody else saw the same amount of humor that I did in that.</p>
